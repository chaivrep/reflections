What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git creates the repository but does not
commit any files.  This allows the user to decide which files should be included
in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working area in that it can contain just a
subset of your files.  It's different from the repository in that it contains
uncommitted versions of files. The staging area is valuable because it allows you
to group your existing files into logical groupings prior to committing them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area includes all files that will be included when you make the next
commit.  You can compare the staging area to the working area using git diff (with no
arguments).  This allows you to determine if there are any other files in the working area
that should be staged, or any staged files that don't logically fit with the other
staged files.  You can then move files to/from the staging area to create a logical
grouping for the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches can be helpful when working on new features that may or may not be added
to the final product, or when you want to create a new version of your project.  
Branches allow you to work on the new feature or version of the project without
affecting the master branch. This allows you to jump back and forth between
branches as needed.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams help to show which commits are reachable on each branch, as well as
which commits are unreachable.  They also allow you to see which commit is at the
tip of each branch, and the parent of each commit.
