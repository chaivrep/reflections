What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git creates the repository but does not
commit any files.  This allows the user to decide which files should be included
in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working area in that it can contain just a
subset of your files.  It's different from the repository in that it contains
uncommitted versions of files. The staging area is valuable because it allows you
to group your existing files into logical groupings prior to committing them.
