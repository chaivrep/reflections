When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be helpful when you need to share files among multiple devices,
like when you're collaborating with others or use multiple computers.  It's also a good
way to back up your code, in case you have a hardware malfunction or accidentally delete
your local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There are a couple of reasons you would want to pull changes from your remote manually:
 - Changes made to the remote could break your local work, so you'll want to choose when
 to make the pull; and
 - You may decide you no longer want to sync with a particular branch on the remote,
 so you'll want to specify a particular branch for the pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

A fork is a special way of making a clone of a repository within GitHub.  You would make
a fork of someone's repo if you wanted to edit it in some way.  A clone is used to make
a local copy of either a remote or local repository.  Cloning allows you to make changes
to files on your local machine.  A branch is used within a repository; it allows you to make
new changes and commits to files without affecting copies of those files on other branches.
Branches are helpful, for example, when you want to create a new feature, but you want to
preserve a copy of the original code and continue to work on it indenpendently of the branch
containing the new feature.
